# mLoot

1. Collects probability ranking (`probability.json`) of mLoot bags from [anish-agnihotri/dhof-loot](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/dhof-loot/blob/master/derivatives/temporal-loot/output/probability.json). File not commited in this repo due to Git max filesize (use LFS download from `dhof-loot` instead)
2. Assigns minting block numbers to all loot bags via `collect.js`
3. Visualizes distribution of mints (assuming no address splittingâ€”as in, users masking exploitation through minting from many addresses) in `visualize.ipynb`
